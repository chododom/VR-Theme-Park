# PROJECT 2

## Ferris Wheel exhibit
- adjustable parameters: wheel shape, cabin count, speed, direction
- adjustments possible by passing in constructor and also in-game with use of sliders
- sometimes, sliders bug and stay pinned to cabins (I think it's a bug in given User.js code, but maybe the error is on my side, everything that I tried didn't fix it)

## Beat Saber 2.0 game
- adjustable parameters: cube speed, cube size, spawn rate of cubes
- adjustable both by passing parameters or in-game before the start of a round
- includes music, so #SOUND_ON
- light saber model was a last minute attachment, hitbox should work (was adjusted accordingly), but it is generally better to hit in a stabbing motion closer to the tip of the light saber and not swing too fast, the animation loop isn't updating fast enough for certain speeds
